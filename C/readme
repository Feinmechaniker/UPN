This is the scource code for a small Assembler / disassembler for BORIS programs.

It can be compiled using either gcc or VisualC

Both are command line tools, usage is :

comp infile.bsm > outfile.bor
decomp infile.bor > outfile.bsm

Initial version is compatible with 
- boris v 2.15
- BCommander 

Later versions are compatible with the upgraded boris5 (using command line switch)

Remark: EEPROM dumps of the ATMega EEPROM have a swapped byte order!

terminal - a command line tool to communicate with boris via serial line. needs boris v2.17

new command line option -6 enabled the Voyager-mode.
